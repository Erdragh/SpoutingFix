# SpoutingFix
Fixes an issue with Create Fabric's REI implementation that causes an error when a sequenced assembly has multiple fluid steps.

This is only a temporary mod, [the respective PR](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/pull/1490)
has already been merged into the Create codebase.
